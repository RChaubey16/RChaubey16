### Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px" alt="waving hand" />  
I’m [**Ruturaj**](https://ruturajchaubey.com), a full stack engineer based in India.

I love building things that work beautifully, whether it’s a clean UI or a rock-solid backend.

Outside of code, you’ll find me: hitting the gym, playing badminton or watching a ~~sitcom~~ football game.

Fun Facts:
- *How I met your mother* is my favorite sitcom.
- I remember random movie quotes better than people’s birthdays.

Currently working on: building apps with AI integration ([Name my variable](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RuturajChaubey.name-my-variable)) and learning more about cloud architecture.
