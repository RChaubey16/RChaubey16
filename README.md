### Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/blob/master/wave.gif" width="30px" alt="waving hand" />  
I’m [**Ruturaj**](https://ruturaj-xyz.vercel.app), a Full Stack Engineer based in India.

I build things that are fast, clean, and reliable, whether that’s a crisp UI or a backend that doesn’t crack under pressure.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me at the gym, on a badminton court, or watching a sitcom or a football match.

**Fun Facts**
- *How I Met Your Mother* is my all-time favorite sitcom.  
- I can quote movies better than I can remember birthdays.

I’m currently diving into [Go](http://go.dev/), and [this](https://github.com/RChaubey16/todo-list-cli) is the latest project I’ve built with it.
